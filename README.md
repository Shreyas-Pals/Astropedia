Well - This is just a simple personal project I had made in 2020..
I was always fond of Astronomy, and I want to step up my game- by trying to integrate CSE in scientific fields contributing to advancements in science!

I had planned to build a Solar System simulator (a 9-body problem if interactions between every two bodies are considered, though I would likely simplify it by ignoring some), using SFML/SDL2 for my CRUx submission. I wanted to include it as another module in this project, but due to time constraints and falling sick, I couldn’t complete it—so I’m submitting this instead.

Thank You!
