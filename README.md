Well - This is just a simple personal project I had made for my self in grade 8.. I wrote mostly everything from scratch, well except the content ofcourse, but I'm proud of the CSS i wrote that time.. I can't even recall that much CSS now.
I was always found of Astronomy, and I really want to actually step up the game when it comes to integrating Computer Science in scientific fields - which can help to take major steps again in Science.

I was actually planning to make a Solar System simulator(Its a 9 body interaction (or) problem if interaction between every 2 bodies is considered but i would probably ignore some of them.) in SFML/SDL 2 for The CruX submission which i would add as
another page in this project, but time didn't permit, and I fell sick.. so this is what I have to upload.

Thank You
