                    Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe. It has two sibling sciences, astronomy and cosmology, and the lines between them blur.<br><br>
                    In the most rigid sense:

                    <ul><li>Astrophysics creates physical theories of small to medium-size structures in the universe</li></ul>

                    <span class = "nwork">While astronomy is one of the oldest sciences, theoretical astrophysics began with Isaac Newton. Prior to Newton, astronomers described the motions of heavenly bodies using complex mathematical models without a physical basis. Newton showed that a single theory simultaneously explains the orbits of moons and planets in space and the trajectory of a cannonball on Earth. This added to the body of evidence for the (then) startling conclusion that the heavens and Earth are subject to the same physical laws.</span>

                    Stellar astronomy is the study of the sun and the stars: what they are, how they move, and how they are born, live, and die. The major challenge of this field is the staggering distance to even the closest stars. Scientists had great difficulty understanding stars without being able to touch them and experiment upon them. This difficulty required radical, creative thinking and a constant willingness to embrace new ideas and techniques

                    Historical Background and Scientific Foundations
                </h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    The motion of the sun, both on a daily and annual basis, is one of the most basic human observations of the sky. Most ancient civilizations developed techniques of varying sophistication for tracking, recording, and predicting these motions for agricultural and ritual purposes. Some devices have survived in the form of structures, such as Stonehenge in England.
                    <br><br>
                    Greek astronomers only investigated the stars as points against which to measure the motion of the planets. Despite their limited tools, Greek astronomers were able to make impressive estimates of the size and distance to the sun. Aristarchus of Samos (c.310–c.230 BC) used the geometry of eclipses to calculate that the sun was roughly 19 times as far away from Earth as the moon, and that the sun was about 6ﬂ the size of Earth. These numbers are far smaller than modern values, but represent a significant achievement of mathematics for their day.

                <h3 class="h3" style="text-shadow:4px 2px 2px #72615F; font-weight:bolder">The Sun at the Center</h3>
                <p class="p1">
                    Two factors, conceptual and observational, combined in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to make the sun a focus of interest. The first was the emergence of the idea that the sun was in some way special. The stimulus for this elevation of the sun's significance is usually attributed to the Polish astronomer Nicolas Copernicus (1473–1543), whose cosmological system placed the sun at the center of the universe. Copernicus' motivations were complex, but he argued that the sun was the most important celestial body and that a central location was more fitting: “At rest, in the middle of everything, is the Sun. For in this most beautiful temple, who would place this lamp in another or better position than that from which it can light up everything at the same time?”
                    <br><br>
                    One of Copernicus' most ardent followers, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), thought the central location of the sun had important physical and theological significance. He thought it might provide a physical force that moved the planets. He made little progress with this idea, but it provided the foundational concept that the sun had physical effects on the planets. From his cultural background, Kepler also saw Christian theological meaning in the structure of the Copernican cosmos.

                    Planetary science or, more rarely, planetology, is the scientific study of planets, moons, and planetary systems and the processes that form them. It studies objects ranging in size from micrometeoroids to gas giants, aiming to determine their composition, dynamics, formation, interrelations and history.
                    This is both an observational and a theoretical science. Observational researchers are predominantly concerned with the study of the small bodies of the Solar System: those that are observed by telescopes, both optical and radio, so that characteristics of these bodies such as shape, spin, surface materials and weathering are determined, and the history of their formation and evolution can be understood.

                    Galactic astronomy is the study of the Milky Way galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to extragalactic astronomy, which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.
                    <br><br>
                    Galactic astronomy should not be confused with galaxy formation and evolution, which is the general study of galaxies, their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Milky Way galaxy, where the Solar System belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible wavelengths by regions of cosmic dust. The development of radio astronomy, infrared astronomy and submillimetre astronomy in the 20th Century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

                        Physical Cosmology
                    </h2>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Physical cosmology is a branch of cosmology concerned with the study of cosmological models. A cosmological model, or simply cosmology, provides a description of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the universe and allows study of fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed those physical laws to be understood. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond the Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang theory, by Georges Lemaître, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory best explains the observations. 
                    <br><br>
                    Dramatic advances in observational cosmology since the 1990s, including the cosmic microwave background, distant supernovae and galaxy redshift surveys, have led to the development of a standard model of cosmology. This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.
                    <br><br>
                    Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied physics. Areas relevant to cosmology include particle physics experiments and theory, theoretical and observational astrophysics, general relativity, quantum mechanics, and plasma physics.

                    <h3 class="h3">Energy of the Cosmos</h3>
                    <p class="p1">
                        The lightest chemical elements, primarily hydrogen and helium, were created during the Big Bang through the process of nucleosynthesis. In a sequence of stellar nucleosynthesis reactions, smaller atomic nuclei are then combined into larger atomic nuclei, ultimately forming stable iron group elements such as iron and nickel, which have the highest nuclear binding energies. The net process results in a later energy release, meaning subsequent to the Big Bang. Such reactions of nuclear particles can lead to sudden energy releases from cataclysmic variable stars such as novae. Gravitational collapse of matter into black holes also powers the most energetic processes, generally seen in the nuclear regions of galaxies, forming quasars and active galaxies. 
                        <br><br>
                        Cosmologists cannot explain all cosmic phenomena exactly, such as those related to the accelerating expansion of the universe, using conventional forms of energy. Instead, cosmologists propose a new form of energy called dark energy that permeates all space. One hypothesis is that dark energy is just the vacuum energy, a component of empty space that is associated with the virtual particles that exist due to the uncertainty principle

                        Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It has two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering.

                        There are two bracnches of Aerospace Engineering.
                        They are Aeronautics and Astronautics.

                    <h3 class="h3">Aeronautics</h3>                   
                    <p class="p1">
                        Aeronautics is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight–capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. 
                        <br><br>
                        While the term originally referred solely to operating the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business, and other aspects related to aircraft. The term "aviation" is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air craft such as airships, and includes ballistic vehicles while "aviation" technically does not.
                        <br><br>
                        A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics, which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

                    <h3 class="h3">Astronautics</h3>                   
                    <p class="p1">
                        Astronautics (or cosmonautics) is the theory and practice of travel beyond Earth's atmosphere into outer space. Spaceflight is one of its main applications and space science its overarching field. 
                        <br><br>
                        The term astronautics (originally astronautique in French) was coined in the 1920s by J.-H. Rosny, president of the Goncourt academy, in analogy with aeronautics. Because there is a degree of technical overlap between the two fields, the term aerospace is often used to describe both at once. In 1930, Robert Esnault-Pelterie published the first book on the new research field.
                        <br><br>
                        As with aeronautics, the restrictions of mass, temperatures, and external forces require that applications in space survive extreme conditions: high-grade vacuum, the radiation bombardment of interplanetary space and the magnetic belts of low Earth orbit. Space launch vehicles must withstand titanic forces, while satellites can experience huge variations in temperature in very brief periods.[5] Extreme constraints on mass cause astronautical engineers to face the constant need to save mass in the design in order to maximize the actual payload that reaches orbit.

                        Theory of Special Relativity
                    </h3>
                    <p class="p1">Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity explains how space and time are linked, but it doesn't include acceleration. By including acceleration, Einstein later developed the theory of general relativity, which explains how massive objects in the cosmos distort the fabric of space-time. The theory explains how this distortion is felt as the force of gravity, as it predicts how much the mass of an object curves space-time. Scientists test relativity by observing objects in space and seeing if their behaviors match up with Einstein's explanations of space-time and gravity, for instance by observing how light bends around massive objects as it travels towards Earth.</p>
                    <h3 class="h3">The Big Bang Theory</h3>
                    <p class="p1">
                        Big Bang theory is the leading explanation for how our universe began. According to the theory, the entire universe began as a tiny singularity that went through an explosive expansion 13.8 billion years ago, gradually expanding into the cosmos we see today. Today, astronomers can detect an "echo" from the Big Bang in the cosmic microwave background, a phenomenon that can be detected with radio telescopes. Big Bang Theory is also the name of a popular CBS sitcom about scientists, where several real-life scientists and astronauts have appeared

                    <h3 class="h3">String Theory</h3>
                    <p class="p1">In physics, string theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other.</p>
